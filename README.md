### Oh, hello there! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my little corner of the coding universe!

I'm a full stack developer with a love for all things that can fit in Vue, React, JS, Python, Java, C# or even C++!! I spend my days crafting beautiful, intuitive user experiences and my nights dreaming up new ways to take over the world one line of code at a time. Sometimes I grab some minutes and fight my way through Unity, hoping to make something great, but I am always reminded that it's not as easy as I imagined ... ... But well, who cares, that doesn't really stop me! ðŸ˜Ž

When I'm not coding, you can find me indulging in my latest video game obsession or just going through goofy stuff online.

So go ahead, take a peek at my projects, grab a cup of coffee, and let's see what we can create together! Who knows, maybe you might find my â˜• Teapot â˜• somewhere ðŸ˜ƒ!
